    <p>No need to stress or panic if your beloved coffee maker has broken down because with these
         four easy ways you can keep calm and brew on!
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Brew up a Stovetop Cup</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Start with six ounces of cold water per serving. 
                Then, pour water into a small saucepan over medium-high heat. </li>
            <li>Add 1 tablespoon of coffee per serving to the pan. If desired, add sugar now.</li>
            <li>Bring the coffee mixture to a boil.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat, let it sit for 4 minutes, then pour the coffee slowly and carefully from the pan so the 
                grounds stay in the pan â€” and out of your cup(s).</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Make Turkish Coffee</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Start with 6 ounces of cold water per serving. Then pour water into a small
                 saucepan over low heat.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tablespoon of coffee per serving to the pan. If desired, add sugar now.</li>
            <li>When the water is just about to boil, remove it from the heat and skim off the foam.
                 Place foam into your coffee cup(s).</li>
            <li>Return the pan to the heat and watch for it to get near a boil again,
                 then remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Pour half of the coffee into your coffee cup(s).
                Return the pan to the heat once more. Boil for 15 additional seconds, then remove from heat.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Try a Faux French Press</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil water in a saucepan on the stove.</li>
            <li>In a deep bowl, add 1 tablespoon of coffee per serving.</li>
            <li>Pour a small amount of boiling water over the grounds to saturate them,
                 and then add 6 ounces of water per serving.</li>
            <li>Use a spoon to press the coffee grounds to the bottom of the bowl.</li>
            <li>Pressing the spoon down on top of the grounds, pour the remaining 
                liquid into your coffee cup</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Create a Coffee Bag</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Lay one filter on the counter, and add 2 tablespoons of coffee.</li>
            <li>Bring the ends of the filter together and tie with twine.</li>
            <li>Saturate the bag of coffee in enough water just to soak the grounds,
                then let the grounds soak for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Pour 6 ounces of water into your coffee cup.</li> 
        </ol>
    </ul>
